# 3656_GroupProject

Group Members: @Nicholas Pritchyk @Dylan Ginsberg @drewmcfaul Project involved Numerical methods package https://github.com/cfgnunes/numerical-methods-python. We analyzed three different rootfinding methods, Newton's, bisection, and secant method. We compare the performance of each for each of 5 standard functions. We also analyze and experiment with Newton fractals computed from Newton's method using package https://github.com/lettergram/newtonfractals.
